# Processing Progress Feature Implementation

This update implements a standardized loading indicator and progress status feature across all transaction forms in the Forex Transaction System. The implementation follows a centralized approach to ensure consistency and minimize code duplication.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Standardized Loading Indicator UI
- Created a shared progress indicator CSS file (`progress-indicator.css`) with standardized styling for loading overlays
- Implemented a reusable HTML template (`loading-overlay.html`) for the loading indicator
- Ensured consistent appearance and behavior across all form types

### 2. Client-Side Progress Status Updates
- Created a shared JavaScript file (`progress-indicator.js`) with standardized functions for:
  - Showing/hiding loading indicators
  - Tracking and updating processing steps
  - Handling success and failure cases
- Implemented step-by-step visual progress indicators

### 3. Server-Side Processing Status Updates
- Modified server-side functions to return detailed progress information
- Added `processingSteps` to all form processor response objects
- Ensured consistent step reporting across transaction types

### 4. Error Recovery
- Improved error handling with automatic button re-enabling
- Added proper loading indicator cleanup on errors
- Implemented standardized error message display

### 5. Integration Into System
- Updated form templates to use shared components
- Added `includeProgressIndicator()` function for easy inclusion in all forms
- Updated system setup to create required files automatically

## Benefits of This Approach

### Consistency
- All forms now have identical loading and progress indicators
- User experience is consistent regardless of transaction type

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for all progress indicator code
- Changes to one component apply system-wide

### Extensibility
- Easy to add more detailed progress steps in the future
- Simple to add new forms with the same progress indicators

## Usage

The progress indicator functionality is automatically included in all forms. When processing transactions, the system will:

1. Show a loading overlay when submission starts
2. Display step-by-step progress of the transaction processing
3. Show completion status or error messages
4. Automatically handle button states during processing

## Setup

The new features are integrated into the existing system setup process. Running `setupSystem()` will create all necessary files and configure the system to use the standardized progress indicators.
